Wrap an application in a docker container

>Purpose: Deploy the application in a modern DevOps stack<br>
Result: Wrap the application in Docker

Warning. The job is based on any Web application you have made.

Requirements:
1. Wrap the application in a docker container. It is customary to place the Dockerfile at the repository root. The image should contain the JAR-applications. Building in a container is recommended, but not required.
2. You do not need to wrap the database in its own container (unless you use a custom plugin).
3. Configure communication between containers, using docker-compose.
4. Optional: do it in a local cube.
5. The application should preferably be implemented with all Best Practices Docker (logging to stdout, etc).

This task does NOT count the previous ones!

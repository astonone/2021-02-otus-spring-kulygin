Homework

>Purpose: make it as easy as possible to write a repository layer using modern approaches<br>
Result: an application with a repository layer in Spring Data JPA

Homework is done by rewriting the previous one in JPA.

Requirements:
1. Rewrite all the book repositories to Spring Data JPA repositories.
2. Use spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.
3. Custom repository methods (or with tricky @Query) cover tests using H2.
4. It is recommended to put @Transactional on service methods, not repository methods.

This homework will be used as a basis for other homework. This work does not pass the previous one!

Homework

>Use MongoDB and spring-data to store book information<br>
Purpose: After completing the HT, you will be able to use Spring Data MongoDB and MongoDB itself to develop applications that store data in a non-relational database.<br>
Result: Application using MongoDB

The assignment can be based on the previous one, or it can be done independently

Requirements:
1. Use Spring Data MongoDB repositories, and if there is not enough functionality, then *Operations
2. Tests can be implemented with Flapdoodle Embedded MongoDB
3. Hibernate, as well as JPA, and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa should not remain in dependencies if the HT is executed based on the previous one.
4. How to store books, authors, genres, and comments is up to you. But the structure transferred from a relational database will not always be suitable for MongoDB.

This assignment does NOT pass against previous assignments!

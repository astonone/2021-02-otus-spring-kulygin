Homework

>Use WebFlux<br>
Purpose: Develop Responsive and Resilent applications on the Spring reactive stack using Spring Web Flux and Reactive Spring Data Repositories<br>
Result: Application on the Spring Reactive Stack

Requirements:
1. As a basis for the work you can take a HT with Ajax + REST (classic web application for this is better not to use).
2. But you can choose another domain model (not library).
3. Reactive Spring Data Repositories should be used.
4. As a database it is better to use MongoDB or Redis. Using PostgreSQL and experimental R2DBC is not recommended.
5. RxJava vs Project Reactor - to your taste.
6. Use WebFlux instead of classic Spring MVC and embedded Web server.

Optional: implement on Functional Endpoints

This task does NOT pass the previous ones!

Recommendations: Try to get rid of unnecessary architectural layers. The simplest option is to have all the flow in the controller.

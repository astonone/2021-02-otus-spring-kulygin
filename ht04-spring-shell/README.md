Homework

>Transfer a survey application to Spring Shell<br>
Purpose: After completing the assignment, you will be able to use Spring Shell to write an application interface without the Web.<br>
Result: Spring Shell application<br>.

The homework is based on the previous one.

Requirements:
1. Connect the Spring Shell using spring-starter.
2. Write a set of commands to allow polling.
3. Write Unit tests using spring-boot-starter-test, remember that Spring Shell must be disabled in the tests.

The set of commands depends only on your desire. You can make a single command that runs your Main, or you can build a complete interface on Spring Shell.

You don't need to localize Spring Shell commands (although you can, but it's long and complicated).

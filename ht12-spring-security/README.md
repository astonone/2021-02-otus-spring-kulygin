Result: application using Spring Security

Warning. The task is based on a non-reactive Spring MVC application!

Requirements:
1. Add a new entity to the application - a user. It is not necessary to implement methods to create users - it is acceptable to add users only through database scripts.
2. Add Form-based authentication mechanism to the existing CRUD application.
3. UsersService to implement on their own.
4. Authorization on all pages - for all authenticated. Login form - available to all.

Purpose: to develop full-fledged classic Web-applications<br>
Result: Web-application completely on the Spring stack

Requirements:
1. Create an application with storing entities in the database (you can take the library and DAO/repositories from the past classes)
2. Use classic View on Thymeleaf, classic Controllers.
3. For books (main entity) all CRUD operations should be available on UI. CRUD of other entities is optional.

Localization is NOT necessary - it's strictly optional.
